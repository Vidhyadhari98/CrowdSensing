# CrowdSensing

proximity sensing in Crowdsensing 
 
The goal of the project is to explore and demonstrate the utilization of sensors for proximity sensing in the commuting sector. 
The project aims to develop a system that can accurately detect crowdedness in train coaches and provide real-time information to users. 

Implementing proximity sensing for crowd management in crowded commuting environments offers several key benefits. 
By tracking the proximity of individuals, transportation authorities or service providers can gain real-time insights into crowd density and take proactive measures to ensure crowd safety, prevent overcrowding, and optimize resource allocation.
This technology can help identify potential crowd congestion areas, dynamically adjust transportation schedules or routes, and provide timely notifications or alerts to commuters to avoid crowded areas.
Overall, proximity sensing enables a more efficient and secure commuting experience for passengers while improving overall crowd management. 

User Scenario: 
When someone arrives at the train station, then they can opens the dedicated Android application. 
Based on the information displayed on the application, they can see which train coaches are less crowded, allowing them to choose the most comfortable one for journey.
As we boards the train, we notices that the train coach we selected has a moderate level of occupancy, making our commute more pleasant.
